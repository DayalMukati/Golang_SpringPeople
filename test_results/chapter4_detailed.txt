PATTERN 02: MONOLITH TO MICROSERVICES DECOMPOSITION
================================================================================
Topic: Application architecture evolution from monolith to distributed services
Learning Goal: Understand the decomposition process and benefits/challenges

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PATTERN 2.1: Monolithic Application
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter4-patterns/02-monolith-to-microservices/monolith.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Traditional monolithic architecture where ALL functionality (users, orders,
   payments) lives in a SINGLE application. This represents the "before" state.

   Challenges with monoliths:
   - All code deployed together (cannot scale parts independently)
   - One bug can bring down entire application
   - Large codebase becomes difficult to maintain
   - Different teams stepping on each other's toes
   - Technology stack locked for entire application

🏗️  How It Works:
   - Single Go process handling all endpoints
   - Two handlers: /users and /orders
   - Both run on the same port (8080)
   - Represents tightly coupled architecture

   Code Structure:
   ```go
   func main() {
       http.HandleFunc("/users", usersHandler)
       http.HandleFunc("/orders", ordersHandler)
       http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)  // Single process
   }
   ```

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Starts HTTP server on port 8080
   - GET/POST /users returns "Users endpoint - Monolith"
   - GET/POST /orders returns "Orders endpoint - Monolith"
   - Single point of failure - if process crashes, everything stops

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓
   Command: go build monolith.go
   Result: Binary created successfully with no errors

🌐 Endpoints & Testing:
   Start: ./monolith
   Test: curl http://localhost:8080/users
         curl http://localhost:8080/orders

   Output: "Users endpoint - Monolith" or "Orders endpoint - Monolith"

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Monoliths are simple to develop initially
   - Everything runs in one process = easy debugging
   - But scaling and team collaboration become pain points
   - This pattern shows the "before" state of decomposition

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PATTERN 2.2: User Microservice (After Decomposition)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter4-patterns/02-monolith-to-microservices/user-service.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   After decomposition, the Users functionality is extracted into its OWN
   independent microservice. This service:
   - Runs independently on its own port
   - Can be developed by a dedicated team
   - Can be scaled independently based on user traffic
   - Can fail without bringing down orders

🏗️  How It Works:
   - Separate Go process for user management
   - Listens on port 8081 (different from monolith)
   - Handles ONLY /users endpoint
   - Can be deployed/scaled independently

   Key Change:
   ```go
   // Now runs on its own port
   http.ListenAndServe(":8081", nil)
   ```

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Starts HTTP server on port 8081
   - GET/POST /users returns "Users endpoint - Microservice"
   - Independent lifecycle from other services
   - Can restart without affecting orders service

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓
   Command: go build user-service.go
   Result: Binary created successfully with no errors

🌐 Endpoints & Testing:
   Start: ./user-service
   Test: curl http://localhost:8081/users

   Output: "Users endpoint - Microservice"

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Each microservice owns a specific business capability
   - Port isolation enables independent deployment
   - Service can use its own database, technology stack
   - Teams can work independently on different services

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PATTERN 2.3: Order Microservice (After Decomposition)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter4-patterns/02-monolith-to-microservices/order-service.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Orders functionality extracted as a separate microservice. In FinPay, this
   would handle payment orders, transaction history, settlement processing.

🏗️  How It Works:
   - Independent Go process for order management
   - Listens on port 8082 (unique port)
   - Handles ONLY /orders endpoint
   - Completely decoupled from users service

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Starts HTTP server on port 8082
   - GET/POST /orders returns "Orders endpoint - Microservice"
   - If this crashes, user service continues running
   - Can scale order processing independently during peak hours

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓
   Command: go build order-service.go
   Result: Binary created successfully with no errors

🌐 Endpoints & Testing:
   Start: ./order-service
   Test: curl http://localhost:8082/orders

   Output: "Orders endpoint - Microservice"

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Microservices enable independent scaling
   - Each service has single responsibility (SRP)
   - Network communication required between services
   - Trade-off: Simplicity vs. Flexibility

================================================================================
PATTERN 03: SIDECAR PATTERN
================================================================================
Topic: Cross-cutting concerns handled by auxiliary containers/processes
Learning Goal: Offload non-business logic (logging, metrics, security) to sidecars

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PATTERN 3.1: Payments Service (Main Application)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter4-patterns/03-sidecar-pattern/payments/main.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   In microservices, we need:
   - Audit logs for compliance (PCI-DSS for payments)
   - Enriched logging with fraud scores
   - Centralized log storage

   BUT we don't want EVERY service to implement:
   - Complex logging libraries
   - Database connections for logs
   - Fraud scoring logic

   Solution: Let the payment service focus on payments, delegate logging to
   a sidecar that runs alongside it.

🏗️  How It Works:
   The payments service:
   1. Receives authorization requests at POST /authorize
   2. Makes simple business decision (approve/decline)
   3. Creates an AuditEvent with transaction details
   4. Sends event to sidecar at http://localhost:9000/logs (async)
   5. Responds to client immediately (doesn't wait for log storage)

   Key Pattern:
   ```go
   // Async call to sidecar - non-blocking
   go sendToSidecar(event)

   // Immediately respond to client
   json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(resp)
   ```

   Data Structures:
   - AuthorizeRequest: Client input (user_id, amount, merchant, etc.)
   - AuditEvent: Audit trail sent to sidecar (tx_id, status, reason)

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Listens on port 8080
   - POST /authorize with payment JSON
   - Approves amounts <= 1000 automatically
   - For > 1000: 40% chance of decline (risk simulation)
   - Sends audit event to sidecar (if sidecar running)
   - Returns: {"tx_id":"...", "status":"authorized/declined", "reason":"..."}
   - If sidecar down: logs error but STILL responds to client

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓
   Command: go build main.go
   Result: Binary created successfully with no errors

🌐 Endpoints & Testing:
   Start: cd payments && go run main.go
   Test: curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/authorize \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{"user_id":"U123","amount":500,"currency":"USD","merchant_id":"M456"}'

   Expected: {"tx_id":"...","status":"authorized","reason":""}

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Main service stays focused on business logic
   - Cross-cutting concerns delegated to sidecar
   - Async communication prevents blocking
   - Graceful degradation if sidecar unavailable

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PATTERN 3.2: Log Sidecar (Auxiliary Service)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter4-patterns/03-sidecar-pattern/logsidecar/main.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   The sidecar handles ALL logging concerns:
   - Receives audit events from the main service
   - Enriches events with timestamps, fraud scores
   - Formats for storage (Elasticsearch, S3, etc.)
   - Handles logging infrastructure complexity

   Benefits:
   - Main service doesn't need logging libraries
   - Sidecar can be upgraded independently
   - Reusable across multiple services
   - Can be written in different language (polyglot)

🏗️  How It Works:
   The log sidecar:
   1. Listens on port 9000 for audit events
   2. Receives POST /logs with AuditEvent JSON
   3. Enriches the event by adding:
      - UTC timestamp
      - Fraud score (simple scoring logic)
      - Source service name
   4. "Stores" the enriched event (prints to console for demo)

   Enrichment Logic (simpleFraudScore):
   - Amount > 1000: +10 points
   - Status = declined: +15 points
   - Non-USD currency: +3 points
   - Missing device/IP: +2 points

   Data Structures:
   - AuditEvent: Received from payments service
   - EnrichedEvent: AuditEvent + Timestamp + FraudScore + Source

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Listens on port 9000
   - POST /logs accepts audit events
   - Enriches with timestamp and fraud score
   - Prints formatted JSON to console:
     {
       "tx_id": "...",
       "user_id": "U123",
       "amount": 500,
       "status": "authorized",
       "timestamp": "2025-10-01T10:15:00Z",
       "fraud_score": 0,
       "source": "payments-service"
     }
   - Returns HTTP 202 Accepted

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓
   Command: go build main.go
   Result: Binary created successfully with no errors

🌐 Endpoints & Testing:
   Start: cd logsidecar && go run main.go
   Test: Run payments service and make authorization request
         OR directly: curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/logs \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{"tx_id":"TX001","user_id":"U1","amount":1500,"status":"declined"}'

   Expected: Enriched JSON printed to console, HTTP 202 response

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Sidecar pattern = separation of concerns
   - Main app stays lightweight and focused
   - Sidecar handles infrastructure concerns
   - Common in Kubernetes (Istio, Envoy sidecars)
   - Can be deployed in same pod/container group

================================================================================
PATTERN 04: API GATEWAY PATTERN
================================================================================
Topic: Single entry point for all client requests with cross-cutting concerns
Learning Goal: Centralized routing, authentication, rate limiting, request tracking

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PATTERN 4.1: API Gateway (Main Entry Point)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter4-patterns/04-api-gateway/gateway/main.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Without a gateway, clients must:
   - Know URLs of every microservice
   - Implement authentication for each service
   - Handle rate limiting themselves
   - Track requests across services

   Problems:
   - 50 microservices = 50 URLs to manage
   - Security logic duplicated everywhere
   - No central control over traffic
   - Difficult to apply organization-wide policies

   Solution: API Gateway acts as single entry point, handling:
   - Authentication (API key validation)
   - Rate limiting (per IP address)
   - Request tracking (X-Request-ID header)
   - Routing to backend services
   - Response aggregation

🏗️  How It Works:
   Gateway Processing Pipeline:
   1. Client sends request to gateway (port 8000)
   2. Validate API key (X-API-Key header)
   3. Check rate limit (5 requests per 10 seconds per IP)
   4. Generate request ID (for distributed tracing)
   5. Route to backend based on path prefix:
      - /users/* -> http://localhost:7001
      - /payments/* -> http://localhost:7002
   6. Proxy request to backend service
   7. Return response to client

   Key Components:
   ```go
   // Route table
   var backends = map[string]string{
       "/users/":    "http://localhost:7001",
       "/payments/": "http://localhost:7002",
   }

   // Token bucket rate limiter
   type bucket struct {
       tokens int
       last   time.Time
   }
   ```

   Rate Limiting Algorithm:
   - Each IP gets 5 tokens per 10-second window
   - Each request consumes 1 token
   - Tokens refill after window expires
   - Empty bucket = HTTP 429 Too Many Requests

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Listens on port 8000
   - Validates X-API-Key header (must be "demo-key-123")
   - Applies rate limiting per IP
   - Adds X-Request-ID to requests/responses
   - Routes /users/* to users service
   - Routes /payments/* to payments service
   - Returns 401 for invalid API key
   - Returns 429 when rate limit exceeded
   - Returns 404 for unknown paths

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓
   Command: go build main.go
   Result: Binary created successfully with no errors

🌐 Endpoints & Testing:
   Prerequisites: Start users and payments services first

   Start: cd gateway && go run main.go

   Test Valid Request:
   curl http://localhost:8000/users/123 \
     -H "X-API-Key: demo-key-123"

   Test Invalid API Key:
   curl http://localhost:8000/users/123 \
     -H "X-API-Key: wrong-key"
   Expected: {"error":"unauthorized"}

   Test Rate Limit:
   for i in {1..10}; do
     curl http://localhost:8000/users/123 -H "X-API-Key: demo-key-123"
   done
   Expected: First 5 succeed, rest return {"error":"rate_limit_exceeded"}

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Gateway provides single entry point for clients
   - Centralizes cross-cutting concerns
   - Shields backend services from direct access
   - Enables policy enforcement at org level
   - Common in AWS (API Gateway), Kong, Netflix Zuul

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PATTERN 4.2: Users Backend Service
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter4-patterns/04-api-gateway/users/main.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Backend service doesn't need to:
   - Validate API keys (gateway does it)
   - Implement rate limiting (gateway does it)
   - Handle CORS (gateway does it)

   It only focuses on user business logic.

🏗️  How It Works:
   Simple mock service that:
   - Listens on port 7001
   - Reads X-Request-ID header (added by gateway)
   - Returns JSON with service name, path, and request ID

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Listens on port 7001 (backend, not exposed to internet)
   - Accessible only through gateway
   - Returns: {"service":"users","path":"/123","request_id":"..."}

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Backend services stay simple and focused
   - Gateway handles infrastructure concerns
   - Services don't need to know about other services

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PATTERN 4.3: Payments Backend Service
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter4-patterns/04-api-gateway/payments/main.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Similar to users service - focuses only on payment business logic.

🏗️  How It Works:
   - Listens on port 7002
   - Returns JSON with payment service info

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Returns: {"service":"payments","path":"/authorize","request_id":"..."}

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Consistent pattern across all backend services
   - Gateway provides abstraction layer
   - Easy to add new services (just update gateway routing)

================================================================================
PATTERN 05: EVENT-DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================
Topic: Asynchronous communication through events for loose coupling
Learning Goal: Decouple producers from consumers using event-driven patterns

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PATTERN 5.1: Payments Service (Event Producer)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter4-patterns/05-event-driven/payments/main.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Traditional synchronous flow problems:
   - Payment service calls Ledger directly (tight coupling)
   - Payment must wait for Ledger to respond (slow)
   - If Ledger is down, payment fails
   - Adding new consumers (analytics, fraud detection) requires code changes

   Event-Driven Solution:
   - Payment emits "payment_authorized" event
   - Doesn't know or care who consumes it
   - Responds to client immediately (fast)
   - New consumers can subscribe without changing payment service

🏗️  How It Works:
   Payment Service Flow:
   1. POST /authorize receives payment request
   2. Makes authorization decision (approve/decline)
   3. If approved:
      a. Creates PaymentAuthorized event
      b. Publishes event asynchronously (go publishEvent)
      c. IMMEDIATELY responds to client (doesn't wait)
   4. Returns response to client

   Key Pattern:
   ```go
   if approved {
       ev := PaymentAuthorized{
           Event:    "payment_authorized",
           TxID:     txID,
           UserID:   req.UserID,
           Amount:   req.Amount,
           Currency: req.Currency,
           Merchant: req.MerchantID,
           When:     time.Now().UTC().Format(time.RFC3339),
       }
       go publishEvent(ev)  // <-- Non-blocking!
   }

   // Respond immediately
   json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(resp)
   ```

   Event Publishing:
   - Sends HTTP POST to ledger's /events endpoint
   - 1 second timeout (fail fast)
   - Logs error if consumer unavailable (doesn't crash)

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Listens on port 9000
   - POST /authorize processes payments
   - Approves amounts <= 1000
   - For > 1000: ~70% approval rate
   - Emits event asynchronously if approved
   - Returns immediately: {"tx_id":"...","status":"authorized","approved":true}
   - If ledger down: logs error but still responds to client

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓
   Command: go build main.go
   Result: Binary created successfully with no errors

🌐 Endpoints & Testing:
   Start: cd payments && go run main.go

   Test:
   curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/authorize \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"user_id":"U123","amount":750,"currency":"USD","merchant_id":"M456"}'

   Expected: {"tx_id":"20251001101500.123","status":"authorized","approved":true}

   Note: If ledger service running, check its console for received event

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Producer doesn't wait for consumers (async)
   - Fast response times (no blocking)
   - Loose coupling (producer doesn't know consumers)
   - Graceful degradation (works even if consumer down)
   - Scalable (multiple consumers can subscribe)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PATTERN 5.2: Ledger Service (Event Consumer)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter4-patterns/05-event-driven/ledger/main.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Ledger needs to:
   - Record all authorized payments
   - Maintain double-entry bookkeeping
   - Process events at its own pace
   - Not slow down the payment service

   Event-Driven Benefits:
   - Ledger subscribes to payment_authorized events
   - Processes events independently
   - Can be slow/busy without affecting payments
   - Can replay events if needed

🏗️  How It Works:
   Ledger Consumer Flow:
   1. Listens on port 9001 for events
   2. POST /events receives PaymentAuthorized event
   3. Validates event type (must be "payment_authorized")
   4. Converts to LedgerEntry with double-entry bookkeeping:
      - Debit: customer_clearing (customer balance reduced)
      - Credit: merchant_receivable (merchant owed money)
   5. "Persists" entry (prints to console in demo)
   6. Returns HTTP 202 Accepted

   Key Pattern:
   ```go
   func toLedgerEntry(ev PaymentAuthorized) LedgerEntry {
       return LedgerEntry{
           TxID:      ev.TxID,
           Debit:     "customer_clearing",
           Credit:    "merchant_receivable",
           Amount:    ev.Amount,
           Currency:  ev.Currency,
           PostedAt:  time.Now().UTC().Format(time.RFC3339),
           Reference: ev.Event,
       }
   }
   ```

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Listens on port 9001
   - POST /events accepts PaymentAuthorized events
   - Validates event type
   - Transforms to double-entry ledger format
   - Prints ledger entry JSON to console:
     {
       "tx_id": "20251001101500.123",
       "debit": "customer_clearing",
       "credit": "merchant_receivable",
       "amount": 750,
       "currency": "USD",
       "posted_at": "2025-10-01T10:15:00Z",
       "reference": "payment_authorized"
     }
   - Returns HTTP 202 Accepted

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓
   Command: go build main.go
   Result: Binary created successfully with no errors

🌐 Endpoints & Testing:
   Start: cd ledger && go run main.go

   Integration Test:
   1. Start ledger service
   2. Start payments service
   3. Send payment authorization
   4. Check ledger console for posted entry

   Direct Test:
   curl -X POST http://localhost:9001/events \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"event":"payment_authorized","tx_id":"TX123","user_id":"U1",
          "amount":500,"currency":"USD","merchant_id":"M1","when":"2025-10-01T10:00:00Z"}'

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Consumer processes events at its own pace
   - Event-driven enables eventual consistency
   - Easy to add more consumers (analytics, notifications)
   - Decouples services (can deploy independently)
   - Foundation for event sourcing and CQRS
   - In production, use message broker (Kafka, RabbitMQ)

================================================================================
PATTERN 06: SERVICE MESH PATTERN
================================================================================
Topic: Infrastructure layer handling service-to-service communication concerns
Learning Goal: Offload networking, security, observability to mesh proxies

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PATTERN 6.1: Payments Service (Mesh-Aware)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter4-patterns/06-service-mesh/payments/main.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Without mesh, each service must implement:
   - Retry logic for failed requests
   - Circuit breakers for downstream failures
   - mTLS for secure communication
   - Distributed tracing
   - Metrics collection
   - Service discovery

   This is COMPLEX and ERROR-PRONE. Service mesh provides:
   - Transparent retries and timeouts
   - Automatic mTLS encryption
   - Distributed tracing headers
   - Metrics without code changes
   - Load balancing

🏗️  How It Works:
   Payments service:
   1. Calls LOCAL mesh proxy instead of ledger directly
   2. URL: http://localhost:15001/ledger/debit (mesh proxy)
   3. Mesh proxy handles:
      - Retries (if ledger slow/failing)
      - mTLS identity verification
      - Tracing headers (X-Request-ID)
      - Load balancing (if multiple ledger instances)
   4. Service code stays simple - NO retry/timeout logic

   Key Pattern:
   ```go
   // Call MESH, not ledger directly
   httpReq, _ := http.NewRequest("POST",
       "http://localhost:15001/ledger/debit",  // <-- Mesh proxy
       bytes.NewReader(body))

   // Simple timeout - mesh does the heavy lifting
   client := &http.Client{Timeout: 2 * time.Second}
   ```

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Listens on port 9000
   - POST /pay processes payment
   - Calls mesh proxy at localhost:15001
   - Mesh adds mTLS headers automatically
   - Returns ledger response to client
   - If mesh unreachable: {"error":"mesh_unreachable"}

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓

🌐 Endpoints & Testing:
   Start: cd payments && go run main.go

   Test (requires mesh proxy and ledger):
   curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/pay \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"user_id":"U1","amount":100,"currency":"USD","merchant_id":"M1"}'

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Service code stays simple and focused
   - Mesh handles infrastructure concerns
   - Transparent to application layer
   - Consistent behavior across all services

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PATTERN 6.2: Ledger Service (Mesh-Protected)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter4-patterns/06-service-mesh/ledger/main.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Ledger requires:
   - Authentication (only authorized services can call it)
   - Identity verification (who is calling?)
   - Protection from retry storms

   Mesh provides:
   - Automatic mTLS (mutual TLS)
   - Service identity in headers
   - Rate limiting and circuit breaking

🏗️  How It Works:
   Ledger service:
   1. Verifies mesh headers (simulated mTLS):
      - X-Mesh-mTLS: true
      - X-Service-Identity: payments
   2. Returns 401 if headers missing/invalid
   3. Randomly simulates slowness/errors (20% slow, 10% error)
      - This triggers mesh retry logic
   4. On success: returns ledger result

   Key Security Check:
   ```go
   // Verify mesh identity
   if r.Header.Get("X-Mesh-mTLS") != "true" ||
      r.Header.Get("X-Service-Identity") != "payments" {
       http.Error(w, `{"error":"unauthenticated_mesh"}`,
                  http.StatusUnauthorized)
       return
   }
   ```

   Chaos Engineering:
   ```go
   n := rand.Intn(100)
   switch {
   case n < 20:
       time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)  // Trigger retry
   case n >= 20 && n < 30:
       return http.StatusInternalServerError  // Trigger retry
   }
   ```

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Listens on port 7002
   - POST /ledger/debit requires mesh headers
   - 20% requests are slow (>500ms) -> mesh retries
   - 10% requests fail with 500 -> mesh retries
   - 70% requests succeed immediately
   - Without mesh headers: returns 401
   - With mesh headers: returns ledger result

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Services verify mesh identity
   - Mesh handles retry logic transparently
   - Chaos testing built-in (simulate failures)
   - Zero-trust security model

PATTERN 6.3: Mesh Proxy (Sidecar)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter4-patterns/06-service-mesh/meshproxy/main.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   The mesh proxy is THE KEY COMPONENT that provides:
   - Automatic retries (up to 2 retries on failure)
   - Per-try timeout (300ms)
   - mTLS header injection
   - Distributed tracing (X-Request-ID)
   - Metrics emission
   - Service identity

🏗️  How It Works:
   Mesh Proxy Flow:
   1. Listens on localhost:15001 (local to payments service)
   2. Receives request from payments service
   3. Adds/validates tracing headers (X-Request-ID)
   4. Injects mesh identity headers:
      - X-Mesh-mTLS: true
      - X-Service-Identity: payments
   5. Forwards to real ledger (localhost:7002)
   6. If timeout or 5xx error: RETRY (up to 2 retries)
   7. Returns final response to caller
   8. Logs metrics (total requests, retries, status)

   Retry Logic:
   ```go
   for attempt := 0; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++ {
       if attempt > 0 {
           totalRetry++
           log.Printf("[meshproxy] retry %d for %s", attempt, target)
       }

       req, _ := http.NewRequest(r.Method, target, bytes.NewReader(inBody))

       // Add mesh headers
       req.Header.Set("X-Mesh-mTLS", "true")
       req.Header.Set("X-Service-Identity", "payments")

       client := &http.Client{Timeout: perTryTimeout}
       resp, err := client.Do(req)

       // Retry on 5xx, break on success or client error
       if lastStatus >= 500 {
           continue  // Retry
       }
       break  // Success or 4xx
   }
   ```

   Metrics:
   ```go
   log.Printf("[meshproxy] req=%d retries=%d status=%d trace=%s",
              totalReq, totalRetry, lastStatus, traceID)
   ```

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Listens on port 15001
   - Forwards all requests to ledger (localhost:7002)
   - Adds X-Request-ID if missing
   - Injects X-Mesh-mTLS and X-Service-Identity headers
   - Retries on timeout or 5xx (max 2 retries)
   - Logs: "[meshproxy] req=1 retries=0 status=200 trace=abc123"
   - If ledger slow: automatically retries
   - If all retries fail: returns 502 Bad Gateway

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓
   Command: go build main.go
   Result: Binary created successfully with no errors

🌐 Endpoints & Testing:
   Start Order:
   1. cd ledger && go run main.go (port 7002)
   2. cd meshproxy && go run main.go (port 15001)
   3. cd payments && go run main.go (port 9000)

   Test:
   curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/pay \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"user_id":"U1","amount":100,"currency":"USD","merchant_id":"M1"}'

   Observe:
   - Payments console: simple log
   - Mesh console: retry logs, metrics
   - Ledger console: receives requests with mesh headers

   Test Retry Behavior:
   - Send multiple requests
   - ~20% will show retry logs in mesh console
   - Mesh automatically handles failures

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Mesh proxy runs as sidecar (same pod/host as service)
   - Handles all networking infrastructure concerns
   - Services use localhost URLs (mesh is local)
   - Transparent to application code
   - Popular meshes: Istio, Linkerd, Consul Connect
   - In production, mesh typically deployed via Kubernetes
   - Zero code changes to add mesh capabilities

PATTERN 07: STRANGLER FIG PATTERN
================================================================================
Topic: Incremental migration from legacy to modern architecture
Learning Goal: Migrate monoliths safely without big-bang rewrites

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PATTERN 7.1: Legacy Monolith
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter4-patterns/07-strangler-fig/legacy/main.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Legacy system that handles everything:
   - Users, payments, orders, reports, admin
   - Cannot be rewritten overnight (too risky)
   - Business still depends on it
   - Contains years of business logic

   Strangler fig allows GRADUAL migration:
   - Extract one capability at a time
   - Route new capability to new service
   - Keep rest in legacy
   - Eventually "strangle" the legacy completely

🏗️  How It Works:
   Legacy service:
   - Handles ALL endpoints initially
   - Listens on port 7000
   - Returns generic response for any path
   - Represents the "before" state

   Over time, endpoints are extracted:
   - Phase 1: /api/users/* moved to new service
   - Legacy continues handling everything else
   - Phase 2: /api/payments/* moved
   - And so on...

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Listens on port 7000
   - Handles all requests
   - Returns: {"service":"legacy","path":"...","request_id":"..."}
   - Never exposed directly to internet (proxy in front)

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Legacy system remains operational during migration
   - Risk mitigation through incremental changes
   - Business continuity maintained

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PATTERN 7.2: Strangler Proxy (Routing Layer)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter4-patterns/07-strangler-fig/strangler-proxy/main.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   The proxy is THE CRITICAL COMPONENT that enables safe migration:
   - Sits in front of legacy and new services
   - Routes requests based on path
   - Clients don't know which service handles request
   - Easy to move more endpoints over time

   Migration Process:
   1. Week 1: All requests -> Legacy
   2. Week 2: Extract /api/users -> New Users Service
      - Proxy routes /api/users/* -> New Service
      - Proxy routes everything else -> Legacy
   3. Week 3: Extract /api/payments -> New Payment Service
      - Update proxy routing
   4. Eventually: Legacy handles nothing, can be retired

🏗️  How It Works:
   Strangler Proxy:
   1. Listens on port 8080 (public entry point)
   2. Checks incoming path
   3. Routes based on pattern:
      - /api/users/* -> New Users Service (localhost:7001)
      - Everything else -> Legacy (localhost:7000)
   4. Adds X-Request-ID for tracing
   5. Proxies request to appropriate backend
   6. Returns response to client

   Routing Logic:
   ```go
   func route(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
       var target *url.URL
       if strings.HasPrefix(r.URL.Path, "/api/users/") {
           target, _ = url.Parse("http://localhost:7001")  // New service
       } else {
           target, _ = url.Parse("http://localhost:7000")  // Legacy
       }

       proxy := httputil.NewSingleHostReverseProxy(target)
       proxy.ServeHTTP(w, r)
   }
   ```

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Listens on port 8080 (public entry point)
   - Routes /api/users/* -> Users Service
   - Routes all other paths -> Legacy
   - Adds X-Request-ID to all requests
   - Transparent to clients (they see single endpoint)

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓

🌐 Endpoints & Testing:
   Start Order:
   1. cd legacy && go run main.go (port 7000)
   2. cd usersvc && go run main.go (port 7001)
   3. cd strangler-proxy && go run main.go (port 8080)

   Test Migration:
   # This goes to NEW users service
   curl http://localhost:8080/api/users/U123
   Response: {"service":"usersvc","user_id":"U123",...}

   # This goes to LEGACY
   curl http://localhost:8080/api/payments/PAY123
   Response: {"service":"legacy","path":"/api/payments/PAY123",...}

   # This goes to LEGACY
   curl http://localhost:8080/api/reports
   Response: {"service":"legacy","path":"/api/reports",...}

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Proxy enables safe, incremental migration
   - Clients unaware of backend changes
   - Easy to rollback (change routing)
   - Can A/B test new services
   - Named after strangler fig tree (grows around host tree)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PATTERN 7.3: New Users Service
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter4-patterns/07-strangler-fig/usersvc/main.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   First extracted capability from legacy:
   - Modern codebase with clean architecture
   - Own database (data migration from legacy)
   - Can use new technology stack
   - Developed by dedicated team

🏗️  How It Works:
   New Users Service:
   - Listens on port 7001
   - Handles ONLY /api/users/* endpoints
   - Extracts user ID from path
   - Returns user profile from NEW datastore
   - Can add features legacy couldn't support

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Listens on port 7001
   - GET /api/users/U123 returns user profile:
     {"service":"usersvc","user_id":"U123",
      "profile":{"name":"Asha","tier":"GOLD"},...}
   - Only accessible via proxy in production

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - First step in strangling legacy
   - Clean slate for new features
   - Can iterate faster than legacy
   - Eventually all capabilities migrated

PATTERN 08: CIRCUIT BREAKER PATTERN
================================================================================
Topic: Prevent cascading failures by failing fast when downstream service unhealthy
Learning Goal: Build resilient systems that gracefully handle dependency failures

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PATTERN 8.1: Payments Service (with Circuit Breaker)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter4-patterns/08-circuit-breaker/payments/main.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Without circuit breaker:
   - Payment calls Risk service
   - Risk service is slow/failing
   - Payment waits... times out... retries...
   - All payment threads blocked waiting
   - Payment service becomes unresponsive
   - CASCADING FAILURE across entire system

   Circuit Breaker Solution:
   - Detect when Risk service is failing
   - Stop calling it (fail fast)
   - Use fallback logic instead
   - Periodically test if service recovered
   - Restore normal operation when healthy

🏗️  How It Works:
   Circuit Breaker States:

   1. CLOSED (Normal Operation):
      - All requests pass through to Risk service
      - Track failures
      - If 3 consecutive failures -> OPEN

   2. OPEN (Fast Fail):
      - Requests DON'T call Risk service
      - Immediately use fallback logic
      - Lasts 10 seconds
      - After 10 seconds -> HALF-OPEN

   3. HALF-OPEN (Testing Recovery):
      - Allow 1 probe request to Risk
      - If succeeds -> CLOSED (normal)
      - If fails -> OPEN (wait another 10 seconds)

   Payment Flow:
   1. Client sends POST /pay
   2. Ask circuit breaker: allow()?
      - If NO (OPEN): use fallback immediately
      - If YES: try calling Risk service
   3. Call Risk with 600ms timeout
   4. Report result to breaker:
      - Success: breaker.report(nil)
      - Failure: breaker.report(err)
   5. Return decision to client

   Implementation:
   ```go
   type breaker struct {
       state     string // "closed","open","half"
       failCount int
       openUntil time.Time
   }

   func (b *breaker) allow() bool {
       if b.state == "open" {
           if time.Now().After(b.openUntil) {
               b.state = "half"
               return true  // Allow probe
           }
           return false  // Fast fail
       }
       return true  // closed or half
   }

   func (b *breaker) report(err error) {
       if b.state == "half" {
           if err == nil {
               b.state = "closed"  // Recovered!
           } else {
               b.state = "open"    // Still broken
               b.openUntil = time.Now().Add(10*time.Second)
           }
           return
       }

       if err != nil {
           b.failCount++
           if b.failCount >= 3 {
               b.state = "open"  // Trip breaker
               b.openUntil = time.Now().Add(10*time.Second)
           }
       } else {
           b.failCount = 0  // Reset on success
       }
   }
   ```

   Fallback Logic:
   ```go
   func fallback(in PayReq) Decision {
       if in.Amount <= 50 {
           return Decision{
               Approved: true,
               Reason:   "challenge_small",
               Mode:     "fallback"
           }
       }
       return Decision{
           Approved: false,
           Reason:   "hold_high_amount",
           Mode:     "fallback"
       }
   }
   ```

✅ Expected Behavior:
   State Machine Behavior:

   CLOSED State:
   - Calls Risk service normally
   - If Risk responds: payment approved/declined based on risk
   - If Risk fails 3 times: breaker trips to OPEN

   OPEN State:
   - Doesn't call Risk service (fast fail)
   - Uses fallback: approve if amount <= 50, else decline
   - Response includes "mode":"fallback"
   - Lasts 10 seconds

   HALF-OPEN State:
   - Allows 1 probe request to Risk
   - If succeeds: back to CLOSED
   - If fails: back to OPEN for another 10 seconds

   Example Responses:
   # Normal operation
   {"approved":true,"reason":"risk_ok","mode":"normal"}

   # During circuit open
   {"approved":true,"reason":"challenge_small","mode":"fallback"}
   {"approved":false,"reason":"hold_high_amount","mode":"fallback"}

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓
   Command: go build main.go
   Result: Binary created successfully with no errors

🌐 Endpoints & Testing:
   Prerequisites: Start risk service first

   Start: cd payments && go run main.go

   Test Normal Operation:
   curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/pay \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"user_id":"U1","amount":30}'

   Observe Circuit Breaker:
   - Send multiple requests
   - ~35% will fail (risk service chaos)
   - After 3 consecutive failures, breaker opens
   - Subsequent requests use fallback (fast response)
   - After 10 seconds, breaker allows probe
   - If probe succeeds, normal operation resumes

   Test Fallback Logic:
   # When circuit open, small amounts approved
   curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/pay \
     -d '{"user_id":"U1","amount":30}'
   Response: {"approved":true,"reason":"challenge_small","mode":"fallback"}

   # Large amounts held
   curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/pay \
     -d '{"user_id":"U1","amount":500}'
   Response: {"approved":false,"reason":"hold_high_amount","mode":"fallback"}

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures
   - Fails fast instead of waiting for timeouts
   - Provides fallback behavior for degraded service
   - Automatic recovery detection
   - Three states: CLOSED -> OPEN -> HALF-OPEN -> CLOSED
   - Essential for resilient microservices
   - Similar to electrical circuit breaker
   - Libraries: Netflix Hystrix, resilience4j, go-resilience

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PATTERN 8.2: Risk Service (Unreliable Dependency)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter4-patterns/08-circuit-breaker/risk/main.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Simulates unreliable downstream service to demonstrate circuit breaker:
   - 20% requests are slow (>1200ms) -> timeout
   - 15% requests return 5xx errors
   - 65% requests succeed normally

   This chaos helps us see circuit breaker in action.

🏗️  How It Works:
   Risk Service Chaos:
   ```go
   n := rand.Intn(100)
   if n < 20 {  // 20% slow
       time.Sleep(1200 * time.Millisecond)  // > payment's 600ms timeout
   } else if n < 35 {  // Next 15% error
       http.Error(w, `{"error":"risk_down"}`, http.StatusInternalServerError)
       return
   }
   // Remaining 65% succeed
   json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(ScoreResp{Score: base(in.Amount), Note: "ok"})
   ```

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Listens on port 7002
   - POST /score calculates risk score
   - 20% of requests take >1200ms (trigger timeout)
   - 15% of requests return 500 error
   - 65% of requests succeed with risk score
   - Risk score: base 10, +40 if amount > 1000

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓

🌐 Endpoints & Testing:
   Start: cd risk && go run main.go

   Test:
   curl -X POST http://localhost:7002/score \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"user_id":"U1","amount":100}'

   Observe:
   - Some requests slow
   - Some requests return 500
   - Most succeed
   - This triggers circuit breaker behavior

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Simulates real-world unreliable services
   - Demonstrates importance of circuit breakers
   - In production, failures happen naturally
   - Circuit breaker protects against these failures

PATTERN 09: CQRS (COMMAND QUERY RESPONSIBILITY SEGREGATION)
================================================================================
Topic: Separate read and write models for scalability and flexibility
Learning Goal: Optimize for different access patterns with separate models

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PATTERN 9.1: CQRS Payment Ledger
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter4-patterns/09-cqrs/main.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Traditional CRUD problems:
   - Same model for reads and writes
   - Complex queries slow down writes
   - Write validation slows down reads
   - Difficult to scale independently
   - Can't optimize for different access patterns

   Example in FinPay:
   - Writing payment transactions is write-heavy
   - Checking balance is read-heavy
   - Same database table for both = contention

   CQRS Solution:
   - Separate WRITE MODEL (ledger): append-only, optimized for inserts
   - Separate READ MODEL (balances): optimized for queries
   - Commands modify write model
   - Queries use read model
   - Async/sync projection from write to read model

🏗️  How It Works:
   Two Models:

   1. Write Model (Ledger):
      - Append-only list of Payment transactions
      - Each payment has: user_id, amount, type (debit/credit), tx_id
      - Never modified, only appended
      - Source of truth

   2. Read Model (Balances):
      - Map of user_id -> current balance
      - Updated from ledger transactions
      - Optimized for fast lookups
      - Can be rebuilt from ledger anytime

   Data Structures:
   ```go
   // Write model
   type Payment struct {
       UserID string
       Amount float64
       Type   string  // "debit" or "credit"
       TxID   string
   }
   var ledger []Payment  // Append-only

   // Read model
   var balances = map[string]float64{}  // Fast lookup
   ```

   Command Endpoint (Write):
   ```go
   // POST /command/pay
   func handlePay(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
       // 1. Append to ledger (write model)
       ledger = append(ledger, p)

       // 2. Update balance view (read model)
       if p.Type == "credit" {
           balances[p.UserID] += p.Amount
       } else if p.Type == "debit" {
           balances[p.UserID] -= p.Amount
       }

       // 3. Return success
       fmt.Fprintf(w, `{"status":"ok","tx_id":"%s"}`, p.TxID)
   }
   ```

   Query Endpoint (Read):
   ```go
   // GET /query/balance?user=U1
   func handleBalance(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
       user := r.URL.Query().Get("user")

       // Read from optimized view
       bal := balances[user]

       fmt.Fprintf(w, `{"user":"%s","balance":%.2f}`, user, bal)
   }
   ```

✅ Expected Behavior:
   Commands:
   - POST /command/pay with payment JSON
   - Appends to ledger
   - Updates balance view
   - Returns: {"status":"ok","tx_id":"TX123"}

   Queries:
   - GET /query/balance?user=U1
   - Reads from balance view (fast)
   - Returns: {"user":"U1","balance":250.00}

   Example Flow:
   1. Credit user U1 with $100:
      POST /command/pay {"user_id":"U1","amount":100,"type":"credit","tx_id":"TX1"}
      Ledger: [{"user_id":"U1","amount":100,"type":"credit","tx_id":"TX1"}]
      Balances: {"U1": 100}

   2. Debit user U1 by $30:
      POST /command/pay {"user_id":"U1","amount":30,"type":"debit","tx_id":"TX2"}
      Ledger: [..., {"user_id":"U1","amount":30,"type":"debit","tx_id":"TX2"}]
      Balances: {"U1": 70}

   3. Query balance:
      GET /query/balance?user=U1
      Returns: {"user":"U1","balance":70.00}

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓
   Command: go build main.go
   Result: Binary created successfully with no errors

   Response: {"user":"U1","balance":70.00}

   Test Multiple Users:
   # Credit U2
   curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/command/pay \
     -d '{"user_id":"U2","amount":200,"type":"credit","tx_id":"TX3"}'

   # Query U2
   curl http://localhost:9000/query/balance?user=U2
   Response: {"user":"U2","balance":200.00}

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - CQRS separates read and write models
   - Commands: optimized for writes (ledger append)
   - Queries: optimized for reads (balance lookup)
   - Can scale reads and writes independently
   - Read model can be rebuilt from write model
   - Foundation for event sourcing
   - Common in financial systems (banking, payments)
   - Enables audit trails (ledger is immutable)
   - Eventually consistent (in async implementations)
   - Trade-off: Increased complexity vs. scalability

KEY LEARNINGS FROM CHAPTER 4:

1. Decomposition Strategy:
   - Start with monolith, extract gradually
   - Each microservice owns specific capability
   - Independent deployment and scaling

2. Cross-Cutting Concerns:
   - Sidecar pattern for auxiliary functionality
   - Service mesh for infrastructure concerns
   - Gateway for centralized policies

3. Communication Patterns:
   - Synchronous: HTTP/REST (gateway, proxy)
   - Asynchronous: Events (event-driven)
   - Both have trade-offs

4. Resilience Patterns:
   - Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures
   - Retries and timeouts (mesh proxy)
   - Fallback logic for degraded operation

5. Migration Strategies:
   - Strangler fig for safe incremental migration
   - Proxy layer enables routing flexibility
   - Zero-downtime migration possible

6. Scalability Patterns:
   - CQRS separates read/write concerns
   - Event-driven enables async processing
   - Service mesh enables transparent scaling

REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS IN FINPAY:

1. Payment Authorization:
   - Circuit breaker protects against risk service failures
   - Sidecar handles audit logging
   - Event-driven triggers ledger updates

2. User Management:
   - API gateway provides single entry point
   - Strangler fig migrates from legacy gradually
   - Service mesh adds mTLS automatically

3. Transaction Processing:
   - CQRS optimizes for write-heavy ledger
   - Event-driven enables real-time notifications
   - Sidecar enriches transactions with fraud scores

TESTING APPROACH:

Runtime Testing (Most Patterns):
- Services are HTTP servers (run indefinitely)
- Requires HTTP client (curl, Postman) for testing
- Multiple services must run simultaneously
- Order matters (start dependencies first)

Example Test Flow:
1. Start backend services (users, payments)
2. Start infrastructure (gateway, proxy, mesh)
3. Send HTTP requests to test endpoints
4. Observe logs in multiple terminals
5. Verify responses and behavior

PRODUCTION CONSIDERATIONS:

1. Service Mesh:
   - In production, use Istio, Linkerd, Consul Connect
   - Automatic mTLS without code changes
   - Distributed tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin)
   - Metrics (Prometheus)

2. Event-Driven:
   - Use message broker (Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS)
   - Event schema registry (Confluent Schema Registry)
   - Event replay for debugging
   - Dead letter queues for failures

3. API Gateway:
   - Use AWS API Gateway, Kong, or Apigee
   - OAuth2/JWT authentication
   - Rate limiting per user/tier
   - Request/response transformation

4. Circuit Breaker:
   - Libraries: Netflix Hystrix, resilience4j
   - Configurable thresholds
   - Metrics and dashboards
   - Alerting on circuit open

5. CQRS:
   - Async projections (Kafka Streams, Flink)
   - Multiple read models (search, reporting, API)
   - Event sourcing for audit trails
   - Snapshot for fast recovery

NEXT STEPS:
- Proceed to Chapter 5: Docker & Kubernetes
- Deploy these patterns in containers
- Orchestrate with Kubernetes
- Add observability and monitoring
