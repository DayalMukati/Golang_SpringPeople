              GOLANG MICROSERVICES - TEST RESULTS DOCUMENTATION
================================================================================

Generated: October 1, 2025
Go Version: 1.25.1
Platform: macOS (darwin/arm64)

OVERVIEW:
This folder contains detailed test results for all chapters of the Golang
Microservices course. Each chapter has its own detailed result file with
comprehensive explanations, code analysis, and test outcomes.

FILES IN THIS FOLDER:
├── README.txt (this file)
├── chapter3_detailed.txt - Go Fundamentals
├── chapter4_detailed.txt - Microservices Patterns
├── chapter5_detailed.txt - Docker & Kubernetes
├── chapter6_detailed.txt - Design Principles
├── chapter7_detailed.txt - Scalability
├── chapter8_detailed.txt - Loose Coupling
└── summary.txt - Overall summary of all tests

WHAT EACH FILE CONTAINS:
- Detailed explanations of what each program does
- Learning objectives and key concepts
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Success/failure status with exit codes
- Key takeaways and best practices
- Code snippets and examples where relevant

HOW TO USE THESE RESULTS:
1. Start with chapter3_detailed.txt for Go fundamentals
2. Progress through chapters 4-8 in order
3. Refer to summary.txt for quick overview
4. Use as study guide alongside the actual code

TESTING METHODOLOGY:
- Each .go file was executed using: go run <filename>.go
- Server applications were analyzed for correct startup
- Output was captured and documented
- Exit codes verified (0 = success)
- Errors and warnings documented

NOTE ON SERVER APPLICATIONS:
Chapters 4-8 contain HTTP servers and microservices that run indefinitely.
For these applications, we verified:
✓ Successful compilation
✓ Correct port binding and startup messages
✓ No compilation errors
✓ Proper code structure and patterns

These servers were not tested for runtime behavior as they require:
- Multiple terminal windows
- HTTP clients (curl/postman)
- Inter-service communication
- Docker/Kubernetes environment (for some)

For full integration testing, refer to each chapter's deployment instructions.

CHAPTER SUMMARY:
- Chapter 3: ✓ 28 tests - All command-line programs tested successfully
- Chapter 4: ✓ 19 files - Service pattern implementations verified
- Chapter 5: ✓ Analysis of Docker/K8s examples
- Chapter 6: ✓ Design principles demonstrated
- Chapter 7: ✓ Scalability patterns documented
- Chapter 8: ✓ Loose coupling techniques verified

FOR QUESTIONS OR ISSUES:
- Review the detailed chapter files
- Check the actual source code in respective directories
- Ensure Go 1.25+ is installed
- Verify all dependencies are available
