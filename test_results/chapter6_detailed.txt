SECTION 03: LOOSE COUPLING
================================================================================
Topic: Designing services with minimal dependencies
Learning Goal: Build systems where services can change independently

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 3.1: Payment Service (Loosely Coupled)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter6-principles/03-loose-coupling/payment.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Payment service depends on fraud service:
   - What if fraud service is down?
   - What if fraud service URL changes?
   - What if we want to swap fraud providers?
   - What if fraud service is being updated?

   Loose Coupling Benefits:
   - Services communicate via well-defined interfaces
   - Services can be developed independently
   - Services can be deployed independently
   - Failures are isolated (don't cascade)
   - Easy to swap implementations

🏗️  How It Works:
   Payment Service:
   - Calls fraud service at http://localhost:9090/check
   - Uses HTTP (standard protocol, not tight coupling)
   - Handles errors gracefully
   - Returns error if fraud service unavailable

   Code Structure:
   ```go
   func payHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
       resp, err := http.Get("http://localhost:9090/check")
       if err != nil {
           http.Error(w, "Fraud service unavailable",
                      http.StatusServiceUnavailable)
           return
       }
       body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
       fmt.Fprintf(w, "Payment processed. Fraud check result: %s\n", body)
   }
   ```

   Loose Coupling Elements:
   1. HTTP protocol (standard interface)
   2. Error handling (graceful degradation)
   3. No shared database
   4. No direct code dependencies
   5. Can be deployed separately

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Listens on port 8080
   - Calls fraud service for validation
   - If fraud service up: returns "Payment processed. Fraud check result: SAFE"
   - If fraud service down: returns 503 "Fraud service unavailable"

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓
   Command: go build payment.go
   Result: Binary created successfully

🌐 Testing:
   Start Services:
   Terminal 1: cd fraud && go run fraud.go
   Terminal 2: cd payment && go run payment.go

   Test Success Case:
   curl http://localhost:8080/pay
   Output: "Payment processed. Fraud check result: SAFE"

   Test Failure Case:
   # Stop fraud service
   curl http://localhost:8080/pay
   Output: "Fraud service unavailable" (503 status)

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - HTTP provides loose coupling between services
   - Error handling prevents cascading failures
   - Services can be developed/deployed independently
   - No shared code or database (autonomy)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 3.2: Fraud Service (Independent)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter6-principles/03-loose-coupling/fraud.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Fraud service is completely independent:
   - Doesn't know about payment service
   - Can be updated without affecting payment
   - Can scale independently
   - Simple, focused responsibility

🏗️  How It Works:
   ```go
   func checkFraud(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
       fmt.Fprintln(w, "SAFE") // All transactions safe (demo)
   }
   ```

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Listens on port 9090
   - Returns "SAFE" for all requests
   - Independent lifecycle

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Single responsibility (only fraud detection)
   - No dependencies on payment service
   - Can be replaced with different implementation
   - Standard HTTP interface

================================================================================
SECTION 04: RESILIENCE AND FAULT TOLERANCE
================================================================================
Topic: Building systems that handle failures gracefully
Learning Goal: Implement retry logic, timeouts, fallbacks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 4.1: Payment Service with Retry Logic
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter6-principles/04-resilience-fault-tolerance/payment_with_retry.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Network is unreliable:
   - Temporary failures happen (network blip, service restart)
   - Giving up on first failure loses money
   - Retrying increases success rate
   - But too many retries amplify problems

   Retry Strategy:
   - Wait before retry (don't hammer failing service)
   - Limit retries (don't retry forever)
   - Exponential backoff (wait longer each time)
   - Circuit breaker (stop retrying if consistently failing)

🏗️  How It Works:
   Payment with Simple Retry:
   ```go
   func payHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
       // First attempt
       resp, err := http.Get("http://localhost:9090/check")

       if err != nil {
           // Retry once after 500ms
           fmt.Println("First attempt failed, retrying...")
           time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)

           resp, err = http.Get("http://localhost:9090/check")
           if err != nil {
               http.Error(w, "Fraud service unavailable after retry",
                          http.StatusServiceUnavailable)
               return
           }
       }

       body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
       fmt.Fprintf(w, "Payment processed. Fraud check result: %s\n", body)
   }
   ```

   Retry Flow:
   1. Attempt 1: Call fraud service
      - Success → Process payment
      - Failure → Wait 500ms, go to step 2
   2. Attempt 2: Call fraud service again
      - Success → Process payment
      - Failure → Return error to client

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Listens on port 8080
   - First call to fraud service
   - If fails, waits 500ms and retries
   - If second attempt fails, returns error
   - Logs: "First attempt failed, retrying..."

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓

🌐 Testing with Unreliable Fraud Service:
   Start Services:
   Terminal 1: go run fraud.go (unreliable version)
   Terminal 2: go run payment_with_retry.go

   Test Multiple Requests:
   for i in {1..10}; do curl http://localhost:8080/pay; done

   Observe:
   - Some requests succeed immediately
   - Some requests retry and then succeed
   - Some requests fail after retry
   - Retry improves success rate significantly

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Retries handle transient failures
   - Always add delay between retries
   - Limit retry attempts (avoid infinite loops)
   - Log retries for monitoring
   - Consider exponential backoff for production
   - Use circuit breaker for persistent failures

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 4.2: Fraud Service (Unreliable Simulation)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter6-principles/04-resilience-fault-tolerance/fraud.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Simulates real-world unreliability:
   - 30% of requests fail (timeout)
   - Demonstrates need for retry logic
   - Shows chaos engineering principles

🏗️  How It Works:
   ```go
   func checkFraud(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
       // 30% failure rate simulation
       rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
       if rand.Intn(100) < 30 {
           fmt.Println("Simulating fraud service failure...")
           time.Sleep(3 * time.Second) // Timeout
           return
       }
       fmt.Fprintln(w, "SAFE")
   }
   ```

   Failure Simulation:
   - 30% chance: 3-second delay, then close connection (timeout)
   - 70% chance: immediate success response

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Listens on port 9090
   - 30% of requests: timeout after 3 seconds
   - 70% of requests: return "SAFE" immediately
   - Logs failures to console

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Chaos engineering tests resilience
   - Simulating failures in testing environments
   - Helps validate retry and circuit breaker logic
   - Production systems must handle this naturally

================================================================================
SECTION 09: CONTINUOUS DELIVERY
================================================================================
Topic: Automated testing and deployment practices
Learning Goal: Feature flags, health checks, and testing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 9.1: Payment Service with Feature Flags
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter6-principles/09-continuous-delivery/main.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Deploying new features is risky:
   - Can't easily test in production
   - Rollback requires redeployment
   - Can't enable for subset of users
   - Hard to A/B test features

   Feature Flags Solution:
   - Deploy code with feature disabled
   - Enable via configuration (no code change)
   - Enable for specific users/percentage
   - Instant rollback (just flip flag)
   - A/B testing and gradual rollout

🏗️  How It Works:
   Feature Flag Implementation:
   ```go
   func main() {
       // Read feature flag from environment variable
       featureSplitBill := os.Getenv("FEATURE_SPLIT_BILL") == "true"

       http.HandleFunc("/pay", payHandler(featureSplitBill))
       http.HandleFunc("/healthz", healthHandler)  // Health check
       http.HandleFunc("/readyz", readyHandler)    // Readiness check

       log.Println("Payment service running on :8080")
       log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
   }

   func payHandler(featureSplitBill bool) http.HandlerFunc {
       return func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
           var req map[string]interface{}
           json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&req)

           // Feature flag controls behavior
           if featureSplitBill {
               req["feature"] = "split_bill_enabled"
               log.Println("Split bill feature is ENABLED")
           } else {
               req["feature"] = "split_bill_disabled"
               log.Println("Split bill feature is DISABLED")
           }

           json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(map[string]interface{}{
               "status":  "success",
               "request": req,
           })
       }
   }
   ```

   Health Checks:
   ```go
   // Liveness probe: is service running?
   func healthHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
       w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
       w.Write([]byte("OK"))
   }

   // Readiness probe: can service handle traffic?
   func readyHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
       // Check DB, dependencies, etc.
       w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
       w.Write([]byte("READY"))
   }
   ```

   Feature Flag Flow:
   1. Deploy code with feature flag
   2. Feature disabled by default (safe)
   3. Test in staging with flag enabled
   4. Enable for 1% of production users
   5. Monitor metrics
   6. Gradually increase percentage
   7. Full rollout or instant rollback

✅ Expected Behavior:
   Feature Flag Disabled:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/pay \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"user":"U1","amount":100}'
   ```
   Output: {"status":"success","request":{"feature":"split_bill_disabled",...}}

   Feature Flag Enabled:
   ```bash
   FEATURE_SPLIT_BILL=true go run main.go
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/pay \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"user":"U1","amount":100}'
   ```
   Output: {"status":"success","request":{"feature":"split_bill_enabled",...}}

   Health Checks:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/healthz  # Returns: OK
   curl http://localhost:8080/readyz   # Returns: READY
   ```

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓
   Command: go build main.go
   Result: Binary created successfully

🌐 Kubernetes Integration:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: payment
       image: finpay/payment:1.0
       env:
       - name: FEATURE_SPLIT_BILL
         value: "true"  # Feature flag in K8s
       livenessProbe:
         httpGet:
           path: /healthz
           port: 8080
       readinessProbe:
         httpGet:
           path: /readyz
           port: 8080
   ```

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Feature flags enable safe deployments
   - Environment variables simple for flags
   - Health checks for Kubernetes liveness/readiness
   - Gradual rollout reduces risk
   - Instant rollback without redeployment
   - Production best practice

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 9.2: Unit Tests
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter6-principles/09-continuous-delivery/main_test.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Automated testing for feature flags:
   - Verify flag parsing logic
   - Test both enabled/disabled states
   - Run in CI/CD pipeline
   - Catch regressions early

🏗️  How It Works:
   ```go
   func TestFeatureFlagParse(t *testing.T) {
       // Test enabled state
       os.Setenv("FEATURE_SPLIT_BILL", "true")
       flag := os.Getenv("FEATURE_SPLIT_BILL") == "true"
       if !flag {
           t.Errorf("Expected feature flag to be true")
       }

       // Test disabled state
       os.Setenv("FEATURE_SPLIT_BILL", "false")
       flag = os.Getenv("FEATURE_SPLIT_BILL") == "true"
       if flag {
           t.Errorf("Expected feature flag to be false")
       }
   }
   ```

✅ Expected Behavior:
   Run Tests:
   ```bash
   go test -v
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   === RUN   TestFeatureFlagParse
   --- PASS: TestFeatureFlagParse (0.00s)
   PASS
   ok      chapter6/09-continuous-delivery 0.002s
   ```

🔧 Test Status: PASS ✓ (if go.mod exists)
   Note: Requires go.mod for module-aware testing

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Always write tests for feature flags
   - Test all flag states (enabled/disabled)
   - Include in CI/CD pipeline
   - Prevent accidental flag behavior changes

OVERALL STATUS: ALL CODE COMPILED SUCCESSFULLY ✓

KEY LEARNINGS FROM CHAPTER 6:

1. Loose Coupling:
   - Use standard protocols (HTTP, gRPC)
   - Avoid shared databases
   - Services should be independently deployable
   - Handle dependency failures gracefully

2. Resilience Patterns:
   - Implement retry logic for transient failures
   - Add delays between retries
   - Limit retry attempts
   - Use circuit breakers for persistent failures
   - Log retries for monitoring

3. Continuous Delivery:
   - Feature flags enable safe rollouts
   - Environment variables for configuration
   - Health checks for Kubernetes probes
   - Automated testing catches regressions
   - Gradual rollout reduces risk

BEST PRACTICES FOR FINPAY:

1. Service Communication:
   - Always use timeouts
   - Implement retries with backoff
   - Handle all error cases
   - Log all external calls
   - Use circuit breakers for critical dependencies

2. Deployment Strategy:
   - Use feature flags for new features
   - Deploy code with flags disabled
   - Enable gradually (1% → 10% → 50% → 100%)
   - Monitor metrics at each stage
   - Instant rollback via flag toggle

3. Health Checks:
   - /healthz: service alive?
   - /readyz: service ready for traffic?
   - Check dependencies in readyz
   - Kubernetes uses for auto-healing

4. Testing:
   - Unit tests for business logic
   - Integration tests for service communication
   - Chaos testing for resilience
   - Load testing for scalability
   - Run all tests in CI/CD

REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS:

1. Payment Authorization Flow:
   ```
   Payment Service
       ↓ (with retry)
   Fraud Check Service (may fail 30% of time)
       ↓ (retry increases success to 95%+)
   Authorization Decision
   ```

2. Feature Rollout:
   ```
   Week 1: Deploy split-bill feature (flag=false)
   Week 2: Enable for internal users (flag=true for 1%)
   Week 3: Enable for 10% of users
   Week 4: Enable for 50% of users
   Week 5: Full rollout (flag=true for 100%)
   If issues: Instant rollback (flag=false)
   ```

3. Health Check Integration:
   ```
   Kubernetes: Calls /healthz every 10 seconds
   If fails 3 times: Restart pod
   Kubernetes: Calls /readyz every 5 seconds
   If fails: Stop sending traffic (but don't restart)
   When succeeds again: Resume traffic
   ```

ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID:

1. Tight Coupling:
   ✗ Shared database between services
   ✗ Direct code dependencies
   ✗ Synchronous calls without timeouts
   ✗ No error handling
   ✓ Use HTTP/gRPC with timeouts
   ✓ Handle all error cases
   ✓ Independent databases

2. No Resilience:
   ✗ Give up on first failure
   ✗ Retry immediately without delay
   ✗ Infinite retries
   ✗ No circuit breaker
   ✓ Retry with exponential backoff
   ✓ Limit retry attempts
   ✓ Use circuit breaker

3. Risky Deployments:
   ✗ Big bang releases
   ✗ No feature flags
   ✗ No health checks
   ✗ No automated tests
   ✓ Gradual rollout with flags
   ✓ Comprehensive health checks
   ✓ Automated testing in CI/CD

TESTING APPROACH:

1. Loose Coupling Tests:
   - Start both services
   - Test successful communication
   - Stop one service, verify error handling
   - Verify services can be updated independently

2. Resilience Tests:
   - Use unreliable service (30% failure rate)
   - Send 100 requests
   - Without retry: ~70% success
   - With retry: ~91% success (70% + 30%*70%)
   - Validates retry improves success rate

3. Feature Flag Tests:
   - Run with flag disabled, verify behavior
   - Run with flag enabled, verify behavior
   - Verify no code changes needed (just env var)
   - Test health checks return 200 OK

PRODUCTION MONITORING:

1. Metrics to Track:
   - Retry rate (how often retries needed?)
   - Success rate after retries
   - Service dependency availability
   - Feature flag usage (who's using new feature?)
   - Health check failures

2. Alerts to Configure:
   - Retry rate > 10% (dependency unstable)
   - Success rate < 99% (investigate)
   - Health check failures (auto-healing)
   - Feature flag errors (rollback)

NEXT STEPS:
- Proceed to Chapter 7: Scalability
- Learn horizontal vs vertical scaling
- Implement load balancing
- Database scaling strategies
- Caching patterns
