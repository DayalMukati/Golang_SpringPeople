SECTION 01: MICROSERVICES INTRODUCTION
================================================================================
Topic: Basic microservices for containerization
Learning Goal: Understand simple services before containerizing them

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 1.1: Payment Service (Basic)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter5-docker-k8s/01-microservices-intro/payment_service.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Basic payment processing service that will be containerized. This represents
   a simple microservice before adding Docker/Kubernetes complexity.

🏗️  How It Works:
   - Simple HTTP service on port 8082
   - Single endpoint: /pay
   - Returns JSON: {"status":"Payment Successful","amount":100}
   - Foundation for learning containerization

   Code Structure:
   ```go
   type PaymentResponse struct {
       Status string `json:"status"`
       Amount int    `json:"amount"`
   }

   func paymentHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
       resp := PaymentResponse{Status: "Payment Successful", Amount: 100}
       json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(resp)
   }
   ```

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Listens on port 8082
   - GET/POST /pay returns payment success JSON
   - Ready for containerization

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓
   Command: go build payment_service.go
   Result: Binary created successfully

🌐 Testing:
   Start: ./payment_service
   Test: curl http://localhost:8082/pay
   Output: {"status":"Payment Successful","amount":100}

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Simple service, perfect for containerization demo
   - Stateless design (no database)
   - Single responsibility (payment processing)
   - HTTP-based communication

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 1.2: User Service (Basic)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter5-docker-k8s/01-microservices-intro/user_service.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Basic user management service running on separate port.

🏗️  How It Works:
   - HTTP service on port 8081
   - Endpoint: /user
   - Returns user JSON: {"id":"U1001","name":"Ravi"}

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Listens on port 8081
   - Returns user information
   - Independent deployment from payment service

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Multiple services on different ports
   - Each service is independently deployable
   - Foundation for microservices architecture

================================================================================
SECTION 02: BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES
================================================================================
Topic: Understanding microservices trade-offs
Learning Goal: See real challenges like service communication delays

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 2.1: Payment Service with Slow Dependency
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter5-docker-k8s/02-benefits-challenges/payment_service.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Demonstrates a common microservices challenge:
   - Payment service needs fraud check
   - Fraud service is slow (2 second delay simulated)
   - This creates latency in payment processing
   - Shows need for:
     * Async communication
     * Caching
     * Circuit breakers
     * Better orchestration

🏗️  How It Works:
   Payment Service Flow:
   1. Receives payment request
   2. Calls fraud service (simulated with sleep)
   3. Waits 2 seconds (network + processing)
   4. Returns response

   Key Code:
   ```go
   func paymentHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
       // Simulate slow call to Fraud Service
       time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
       fmt.Fprintln(w, "Payment processed successfully")
   }
   ```

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Listens on port 8080
   - Each request takes ~2 seconds to respond
   - Demonstrates latency challenge
   - Shows need for optimization

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓

🌐 Testing:
   Start: go run payment_service.go
   Test: time curl http://localhost:8080/pay
   Output: "Payment processed successfully" (after 2+ seconds)

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Microservices introduce network latency
   - Synchronous calls create cascading delays
   - Solutions needed:
     * Async messaging (events)
     * Caching frequently used data
     * Circuit breakers for failing services
     * Service mesh for retry/timeout
   - This is why Chapter 4 patterns are important!

================================================================================
SECTION 03: DOCKER PACKAGING
================================================================================
Topic: Containerizing Go microservices with Docker
Learning Goal: Multi-stage builds for small, secure container images

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 3.1: Payment Service (Containerized)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter5-docker-k8s/03-docker-packaging/payment.go

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Before Docker:
   - "Works on my machine" problem
   - Different environments (dev, staging, prod)
   - Dependency conflicts
   - Complex deployment process

   With Docker:
   - Consistent environment across all stages
   - Isolated dependencies
   - Easy deployment (just run container)
   - Version control for entire runtime

🏗️  How It Works:
   Simple payment service that will be containerized:
   - HTTP service on port 8080
   - Single endpoint: /pay
   - Returns success message
   - Designed to run in container

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Standalone service
   - Prints "Payment Service running on port 8080"
   - Returns "Payment of 100 processed successfully!"

🔧 Compilation Status: SUCCESS ✓
   Command: go build payment.go
   Result: Binary created successfully

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 3.2: Multi-Stage Dockerfile
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter5-docker-k8s/03-docker-packaging/Dockerfile

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Traditional Docker images are HUGE:
   - Include build tools (Go compiler, libraries)
   - Include source code
   - Include build cache
   - Result: 800MB+ images

   Multi-stage build solution:
   - Build stage: Has Go compiler, builds binary
   - Runtime stage: ONLY has binary and minimal OS
   - Result: ~20MB images (40x smaller!)

🏗️  How It Works:
   Two-Stage Build Process:

   STAGE 1 - Builder:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM golang:1.21 AS builder
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY . .
   RUN go build -o payment-service .
   ```
   - Uses full Go image (golang:1.21)
   - Copies source code
   - Compiles to binary (payment-service)
   - This stage is ~800MB but temporary

   STAGE 2 - Runtime:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM debian:stable-slim
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY --from=builder /app/payment-service .
   EXPOSE 8080
   CMD ["./payment-service"]
   ```
   - Uses minimal Debian image (~50MB)
   - ONLY copies binary from builder stage
   - No Go compiler, no source code
   - Final image ~20-30MB

   Why This Matters:
   - Smaller images = faster deployment
   - Less attack surface (security)
   - Lower storage costs
   - Faster container startup
   - Less network bandwidth

✅ Expected Build Process:
   1. Build stage compiles Go code
   2. Runtime stage copies only binary
   3. Final image is minimal and secure

🐳 Docker Commands:
   Build Image:
   docker build -t finpay/payment:1.0 .

   Check Image Size:
   docker images finpay/payment:1.0
   # Should see ~20-30MB (vs 800MB+ without multi-stage)

   Run Container:
   docker run -p 8080:8080 finpay/payment:1.0

   Test:
   curl http://localhost:8080/pay
   Output: "Payment of 100 processed successfully!"

   Inspect Stages:
   docker build --target builder -t finpay/payment:builder .
   docker images
   # Compare sizes: builder (~800MB) vs final (~20MB)

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Multi-stage builds drastically reduce image size
   - Separation of build and runtime environments
   - Security: production images don't have build tools
   - Performance: smaller images deploy faster
   - Cost: less storage, less bandwidth
   - Best practice for compiled languages (Go, Java, C++)

================================================================================
SECTION 04: KUBERNETES FUNDAMENTALS
================================================================================
Topic: Core K8s resources for microservices deployment
Learning Goal: Understand Pods, Deployments, and Services

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 4.1: Kubernetes Pod Definition
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter5-docker-k8s/04-k8s-fundamentals/pod.yaml

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Pod = smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes
   - Wraps container(s) in Kubernetes abstraction
   - Provides networking (each pod gets IP)
   - Provides storage volumes
   - Co-locates related containers (sidecar pattern)

   But Pods alone are NOT production-ready:
   - No self-healing (if pod dies, stays dead)
   - No scaling (can't run multiple copies)
   - No rolling updates
   - Need Deployment for production!

🏗️  Pod Structure:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: payment-pod
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: payment
       image: finpay/payment:1.0
       ports:
       - containerPort: 8080
   ```

   What This Creates:
   - Single pod named "payment-pod"
   - Runs finpay/payment:1.0 container
   - Exposes port 8080 within cluster
   - Gets unique IP address

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Pod created in Kubernetes cluster
   - Container starts running payment service
   - Accessible within cluster via pod IP
   - If pod deleted, NOT automatically recreated

☸️  Kubernetes Commands:
   Create Pod:
   kubectl apply -f pod.yaml

   Check Status:
   kubectl get pods
   kubectl describe pod payment-pod

   View Logs:
   kubectl logs payment-pod

   Test (from another pod):
   kubectl run -it --rm debug --image=busybox --restart=Never -- sh
   wget -qO- http://<POD_IP>:8080/pay

   Delete Pod:
   kubectl delete pod payment-pod
   # Pod dies and is NOT recreated (need Deployment)

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Pods are mortal (not self-healing)
   - Use for learning, NOT production
   - Production needs Deployment for management

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 4.2: Kubernetes Deployment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter5-docker-k8s/04-k8s-fundamentals/deployment.yaml

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Deployment provides production-grade features:
   - Self-healing: Dead pods automatically restarted
   - Scaling: Run multiple replicas easily
   - Rolling updates: Zero-downtime deployments
   - Rollback: Easy revert to previous version
   - Declarative: Describe desired state, K8s maintains it

🏗️  Deployment Structure:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: payment-deployment
   spec:
     replicas: 3  # Run 3 copies for high availability
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: payment
     template:  # Pod template
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: payment
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: payment
           image: finpay/payment:1.0
           ports:
           - containerPort: 8080
   ```

   Key Concepts:
   1. Replicas: 3 copies for redundancy
   2. Selector: How deployment finds its pods
   3. Template: Pod spec to create
   4. Labels: Metadata for organizing resources

   How It Works:
   1. Deployment creates ReplicaSet
   2. ReplicaSet creates 3 pods
   3. If pod dies, ReplicaSet creates replacement
   4. If node dies, pods rescheduled elsewhere
   5. Update image -> rolling update (1 pod at a time)

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - 3 payment pods running simultaneously
   - Load distributed across pods
   - If pod crashes, immediately recreated
   - Can handle node failures
   - Rolling updates with zero downtime

☸️  Kubernetes Commands:
   Create Deployment:
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

   Check Status:
   kubectl get deployments
   kubectl get pods -l app=payment
   kubectl get replicasets

   Describe:
   kubectl describe deployment payment-deployment

   Scale:
   kubectl scale deployment payment-deployment --replicas=5
   # Now 5 pods running

   Update Image:
   kubectl set image deployment/payment-deployment \
     payment=finpay/payment:2.0
   # Rolling update: old pods replaced one by one

   Rollback:
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/payment-deployment
   # Revert to previous version

   Watch Updates:
   kubectl rollout status deployment/payment-deployment

   Delete:
   kubectl delete deployment payment-deployment

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Deployments manage pods lifecycle
   - Self-healing: pods automatically recreated
   - Scaling: easy to add/remove replicas
   - Rolling updates: zero-downtime deployments
   - Production-ready: use Deployments, not bare Pods

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 4.3: Kubernetes Service
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter5-docker-k8s/04-k8s-fundamentals/service.yaml

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Pod IPs are ephemeral (change on restart):
   - Payment pod at 10.1.2.3
   - Pod crashes, recreated at 10.1.2.9
   - Clients lose connection!

   Service provides stable endpoint:
   - Fixed DNS name: payment-service
   - Fixed cluster IP: 10.96.0.10 (example)
   - Load balances across all pods
   - Automatic pod discovery (via labels)

🏗️  Service Structure:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: payment-service
   spec:
     selector:
       app: payment  # Matches pods with label app=payment
     ports:
     - port: 8080        # Service port
       targetPort: 8080  # Pod port
   ```

   How Service Load Balancing Works:
   1. Service created with name "payment-service"
   2. Gets stable cluster IP (e.g., 10.96.0.10)
   3. DNS entry: payment-service.default.svc.cluster.local
   4. Finds all pods with label "app: payment"
   5. Distributes traffic across these pods (round-robin)
   6. If pod dies, automatically removed from rotation

   Client Communication:
   ```
   Client -> payment-service:8080
              ↓
         Service (Load Balancer)
              ↓
        [Pod1] [Pod2] [Pod3]
   ```

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Stable DNS name for clients
   - Load balanced across all payment pods
   - Automatic pod discovery and removal
   - Survives pod restarts

☸️  Kubernetes Commands:
   Create Service:
   kubectl apply -f service.yaml

   Check Status:
   kubectl get services
   kubectl get endpoints payment-service
   # Shows which pods are behind service

   Describe:
   kubectl describe service payment-service

   Test from Another Pod:
   kubectl run -it --rm test --image=busybox --restart=Never -- sh
   wget -qO- http://payment-service:8080/pay
   # Uses DNS name, not IP!

   Watch Endpoints:
   kubectl get endpoints payment-service -w
   # Delete a pod, see endpoint list update automatically

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Services provide stable networking for pods
   - DNS-based service discovery
   - Automatic load balancing
   - Decouples clients from pod IPs
   - Essential for microservices communication

================================================================================
SECTION 05: ORCHESTRATING MICROSERVICES
================================================================================
Topic: Multi-service deployments with inter-service communication
Learning Goal: Deploy and connect multiple microservices

Concept Overview:
This section shows how to deploy a complete microservices ecosystem:
- Payment Service (main service)
- Fraud Detection Service (dependency)
- Notification Service (async consumer)

Each service gets:
- Deployment (for pods)
- Service (for networking)

Services communicate via DNS:
- payment-service calls http://fraud-service:8081/check
- payment-service calls http://notification-service:8082/notify

📁 Location: chapter5-docker-k8s/05-orchestrating-microservices/
Files:
- payment.yaml (Payment Deployment + Service)
- fraud.yaml (Fraud Deployment + Service)
- notification.yaml (Notification Deployment + Service)

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Coordinating multiple microservices:
   - Each service needs own deployment
   - Services need to discover each other
   - Network communication between services
   - Managing dependencies (fraud before payment)

🏗️  How It Works:
   Architecture:
   ```
   payment-service (Deployment: 3 replicas)
       ↓ http://fraud-service:8081/check
   fraud-service (Deployment: 2 replicas)

   payment-service (Deployment: 3 replicas)
       ↓ http://notification-service:8082/notify
   notification-service (Deployment: 2 replicas)
   ```

   Each YAML defines:
   1. Deployment: Manages pods
   2. Service: Provides stable DNS

☸️  Deployment Commands:
   Deploy All Services:
   kubectl apply -f fraud.yaml
   kubectl apply -f notification.yaml
   kubectl apply -f payment.yaml

   Or single command:
   kubectl apply -f .

   Verify:
   kubectl get all
   # Shows all deployments, pods, services

   Check Communication:
   kubectl logs <payment-pod-name>
   # Should show successful calls to fraud/notification

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - K8s DNS enables service discovery
   - Services communicate via service names
   - Deployment order matters for dependencies
   - Each service independently scalable

================================================================================
SECTION 06: SERVICE DISCOVERY
================================================================================
Topic: Kubernetes DNS-based service discovery
Learning Goal: Understand how services find each other automatically

📁 Location: chapter5-docker-k8s/06-service-discovery/
Files: payment.yaml, fraud.yaml

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Without service discovery:
   - Hard-code IP addresses (brittle)
   - Manual DNS updates when pods move
   - Service registration required

   Kubernetes DNS provides:
   - Automatic DNS entries for services
   - Format: <service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local
   - Short form: <service-name> (same namespace)
   - Automatic updates when pods change

🏗️  How DNS Service Discovery Works:
   1. Create Service named "fraud-service"
   2. K8s DNS creates entries:
      - fraud-service.default.svc.cluster.local
      - fraud-service (short form)
   3. Payment service calls http://fraud-service:8081
   4. DNS resolves to service cluster IP
   5. Service load balances to fraud pods

   Example:
   ```go
   // In payment service code
   resp, err := http.Get("http://fraud-service:8081/check")
   // DNS resolves fraud-service automatically!
   ```

☸️  Testing Service Discovery:
   Deploy Services:
   kubectl apply -f fraud.yaml
   kubectl apply -f payment.yaml

   Test DNS Resolution:
   kubectl run -it --rm test --image=busybox --restart=Never -- sh
   nslookup payment-service
   nslookup fraud-service
   # Shows IP addresses and names

   Test Communication:
   kubectl exec -it <payment-pod> -- sh
   curl http://fraud-service:8081/check
   # Works without knowing pod IPs!

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - Kubernetes DNS is automatic
   - Use service names, not IPs
   - Works across namespaces (with full DNS name)
   - Zero configuration required
   - Foundation for microservices communication

================================================================================
SECTION 07: SCALING AND LOAD BALANCING
================================================================================
Topic: Auto-scaling based on CPU utilization
Learning Goal: Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for dynamic scaling

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 7.1: Payment Deployment (Scalable)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter5-docker-k8s/07-scaling-loadbalancing/payment.yaml

📝 Standard deployment that HPA will scale automatically.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEST 7.2: Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter5-docker-k8s/07-scaling-loadbalancing/payment-hpa.yaml

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Manual scaling problems:
   - Monitor metrics 24/7
   - Manually adjust replicas
   - React slowly to traffic spikes
   - Over-provision (waste money) or under-provision (lose customers)

   HPA Solution:
   - Automatically scales based on metrics
   - Reacts in seconds to load changes
   - Scales up during peaks
   - Scales down during quiet periods
   - Saves costs while maintaining performance

🏗️  How HPA Works:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
   kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
   metadata:
     name: payment-hpa
   spec:
     scaleTargetRef:
       apiVersion: apps/v1
       kind: Deployment
       name: payment-deployment
     minReplicas: 2   # Never go below 2 (high availability)
     maxReplicas: 10  # Never exceed 10 (cost control)
     metrics:
     - type: Resource
       resource:
         name: cpu
         target:
           type: Utilization
           averageUtilization: 70  # Target 70% CPU
   ```

   HPA Algorithm:
   1. Every 15 seconds, check pod CPU usage
   2. Calculate average CPU across all pods
   3. If > 70%: scale up
      - desiredReplicas = currentReplicas * (currentCPU / targetCPU)
      - Example: 3 pods at 90% CPU
        → 3 * (90 / 70) = 4 pods (rounded)
   4. If < 70%: scale down (but wait 5 minutes to stabilize)
   5. Respect min/max bounds (2-10 replicas)

   Scaling Scenarios:
   - Low traffic (30% CPU): Scale down to 2 pods
   - Medium traffic (70% CPU): Stay at current replicas
   - High traffic (90% CPU): Scale up (add pods)
   - Peak traffic (100% CPU): Scale to max 10 pods
   - After peak (50% CPU): Gradually scale down

✅ Expected Behavior:
   - Starts with 2 pods (minReplicas)
   - During load: scales up to 10 pods
   - After load: scales down to 2 pods
   - Maintains ~70% CPU utilization

☸️  Kubernetes Commands:
   Prerequisites:
   # Metrics server must be installed
   kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml

   Deploy:
   kubectl apply -f payment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f payment-hpa.yaml

   Check HPA Status:
   kubectl get hpa
   kubectl describe hpa payment-hpa

   Watch Scaling:
   kubectl get hpa payment-hpa -w
   # Shows current/target CPU and replica count

   Generate Load (Trigger Scaling):
   kubectl run -it load-generator --rm --image=busybox --restart=Never -- sh
   while true; do wget -q -O- http://payment-service:8080/pay; done
   # Watch HPA scale up pods

   Verify Scaling:
   kubectl get pods -l app=payment -w
   # See new pods being created

   Stop Load:
   # Kill load-generator
   # Watch HPA scale down after 5 minutes

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - HPA enables auto-scaling based on metrics
   - CPU is most common metric (also memory, custom metrics)
   - Protects against traffic spikes automatically
   - Cost optimization (scale down when idle)
   - Requires metrics-server in cluster
   - Configure min/max to prevent runaway scaling
   - Production: use multiple metrics for better decisions

TEST 8.4: GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📁 Location: chapter5-docker-k8s/08-cicd-integration/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml

📝 Problem It Solves:
   Manual deployment problems:
   - Developer runs tests locally (might forget)
   - Builds Docker image on laptop (inconsistent)
   - Manually pushes to registry
   - Manually updates Kubernetes
   - Human errors, slow, not repeatable

   CI/CD Pipeline Solution:
   - Every git push triggers automation
   - Tests run automatically
   - Docker image built consistently
   - Image pushed to registry
   - Kubernetes updated automatically
   - Fast, reliable, repeatable

🏗️  How CI/CD Pipeline Works:
   ```yaml

     push:
       branches: ["main"]  # Trigger on main branch push

   jobs:
     build-test-deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       1. Checkout code
       2. Set up Go 1.21
       3. Run tests (go test ./...)
       4. Build Docker image (with commit SHA tag)
       5. Push to Docker registry
       6. Deploy to Kubernetes cluster
   ```

   Pipeline Flow:
   ```
   Developer Push → GitHub → GitHub Actions
                                  ↓
                            1. Checkout Code
                                  ↓
                            2. Setup Environment
                                  ↓
                            3. Run Tests
                                  ↓ (if pass)
                            4. Build Docker Image
                                  ↓
                            5. Push to Registry
                                  ↓
                            6. Deploy to K8s
   ```

   Step-by-Step Breakdown:

   Step 1: Checkout Code
   ```yaml
   - name: Checkout code
     uses: actions/checkout@v3
   ```
   - Gets latest code from repository

   Step 2: Setup Go
   ```yaml
   - name: Set up Go
     uses: actions/setup-go@v3
     with:
       go-version: 1.21
   ```
   - Installs Go 1.21 in runner

   Step 3: Run Tests
   ```yaml
   - name: Run tests
     run: go test ./...
   ```
   - Runs all tests
   - Pipeline FAILS if any test fails
   - Prevents broken code from deploying

   Step 4: Build Docker Image
   ```yaml
   - name: Build Docker image
     run: docker build -t finpay/payment:${{ github.sha }} .
   ```
   - Uses multi-stage Dockerfile
   - Tags with git commit SHA (unique per commit)
   - Example: finpay/payment:a1b2c3d4

   Step 5: Push to Registry
   ```yaml
   - name: Push Docker image
     run: |
       echo "${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}" | docker login -u ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }} --password-stdin
       docker push finpay/payment:${{ github.sha }}
   ```
   - Logs into Docker Hub (credentials from GitHub Secrets)
   - Pushes image to registry
   - Now available for Kubernetes to pull

   Step 6: Deploy to Kubernetes
   ```yaml
   - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
     uses: azure/k8s-deploy@v4
     with:
       manifests: k8s/payment-deployment.yaml
       images: finpay/payment:${{ github.sha }}
       namespace: default
   ```
   - Updates Kubernetes deployment
   - Uses new image with commit SHA
   - Triggers rolling update in cluster
   - Zero downtime deployment

✅ Expected Pipeline Behavior:
   1. Developer commits code and pushes to main
   2. GitHub Actions starts workflow
   3. Tests run (must pass)
   4. Docker image built
   5. Image pushed to registry
   6. Kubernetes deployment updated
   7. Old pods replaced with new pods (rolling)
   8. Service continues running (no downtime)
   9. GitHub shows green checkmark ✓

   If tests fail:
   - Pipeline stops at test step
   - No image built or deployed
   - Developer notified via GitHub
   - Fix tests and push again

🌐 Setup Requirements:
   1. GitHub Repository with code
   2. GitHub Secrets configured:
      - DOCKER_USERNAME
      - DOCKER_PASSWORD
      - K8s credentials (for deployment)
   3. Kubernetes cluster accessible
   4. Docker registry account

💡 Key Takeaways:
   - CI/CD automates entire deployment process
   - Tests prevent broken code from reaching production
   - Every commit gets unique Docker tag (git SHA)
   - Rolling updates ensure zero downtime
   - Rollback is easy (use previous image tag)
   - Fast feedback (developers know immediately if something breaks)
   - Consistent builds (no "works on my machine")
   - Production best practice: ALWAYS use CI/CD

   CI/CD Benefits for FinPay:
   - Deploy payment features multiple times per day
   - Automated testing prevents fraud bugs
   - Fast rollback if issues detected
   - Audit trail (know exactly what's deployed)
   - Developer productivity (no manual steps)

KEY LEARNINGS FROM CHAPTER 5:

1. Docker Containerization:
   - Multi-stage builds reduce image size 40x
   - Separation of build and runtime environments
   - Consistent deployments across environments
   - Security: minimal attack surface

2. Kubernetes Orchestration:
   - Pods: smallest deployable unit
   - Deployments: self-healing, scaling, updates
   - Services: stable networking, load balancing
   - DNS: automatic service discovery

3. Microservices Communication:
   - Service-to-service via DNS names
   - Load balancing built-in
   - No hard-coded IPs required
   - Resilient to pod failures

4. Auto-Scaling:
   - HPA monitors metrics (CPU, memory)
   - Automatically adjusts pod count
   - Min/max bounds for cost control
   - Responds to traffic patterns

5. CI/CD Pipeline:
   - Automated testing prevents bugs
   - Docker images tagged with git SHA
   - Zero-downtime deployments
   - Fast rollback capability

DOCKER BEST PRACTICES:

1. Multi-Stage Builds:
   - Always use for compiled languages
   - Keep final image minimal
   - Use alpine or slim base images

2. Image Tagging:
   - Never use :latest in production
   - Use semantic versioning or git SHA
   - Enables easy rollback

3. Security:
   - Scan images for vulnerabilities
   - Use official base images
   - Run as non-root user

KUBERNETES BEST PRACTICES:

1. Resource Management:
   - Always set resource requests/limits
   - Right-size based on monitoring
   - Use HPA for dynamic scaling

2. High Availability:
   - Run multiple replicas (min 2)
   - Spread across availability zones
   - Use pod disruption budgets

3. Configuration:
   - Use ConfigMaps for config
   - Use Secrets for credentials
   - Never hard-code in images

4. Networking:
   - Use Services for stable endpoints
   - Leverage DNS for discovery
   - Consider service mesh for advanced routing

5. Deployment Strategy:
   - Use rolling updates (default)
   - Set proper readiness/liveness probes
   - Test in staging before production

CI/CD BEST PRACTICES:

1. Testing:
   - Run all tests in pipeline
   - Include integration tests
   - Fail fast on test failures

2. Security:
   - Scan images for vulnerabilities
   - Use secrets management
   - Audit deployments

3. Deployment:
   - Use blue-green or canary for critical services
   - Monitor deployment health
   - Automate rollback on failures

   (HPA: 2-10)  (HPA: 3-20)   (HPA: 2-8)

   Each service:
   - Docker container (multi-stage build)
   - Kubernetes Deployment (self-healing)
   - Service (load balancing)
   - HPA (auto-scaling)
   - CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
```

PRODUCTION CONSIDERATIONS:

1. Monitoring:
   - Prometheus for metrics
   - Grafana for dashboards
   - Alert on HPA scaling events

2. Logging:
   - Centralized logging (ELK/EFK stack)
   - Structured logs (JSON)
   - Correlation IDs for tracing

3. Security:
   - Network policies (restrict pod communication)
   - Pod security policies
   - Image scanning in CI/CD
   - Secrets encrypted at rest

4. Disaster Recovery:
   - Backup etcd (K8s state)
   - Multi-region deployment
   - Automated failover

5. Cost Optimization:
   - Use HPA to scale down in off-hours
   - Node auto-scaling
   - Resource quotas per namespace
   - Monitor and right-size

TESTING APPROACH:

Go Code:
- Compiled successfully (all files)
- Ready for containerization
